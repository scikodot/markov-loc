# Markov localization
C# implementation of the Markov localization algorithm.

This project is written in C# (Windows Forms) and demonstrates how Markov localization works.
A mobile robot moves on a plane in 4 directions, and the algorithm tracks its position, determining the robot's position.
A notable property of this algorithm is that it operates without any feedback from sensors, etc.
Instead, it determines the presence probability of a robot on certain tiles of the map.

*Note: this project was made as a university task long ago and contains a dirty code (perhaps with some bugs as well). If you're about to use it, be careful.*
